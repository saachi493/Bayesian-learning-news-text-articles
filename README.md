# Bayesian-learning-news-text-articles
Bayesian learning for classifying news text articles.

With the explosive growth of online information, it is not easy for 
people to figure out which information is in his/her interests. For 
instance, thousands of articles in newsgroups often let one very 
hard to pick up something he/she really would like to see. Thus, it 
will be nice if we have tools which can group huge number of 
documents into different categories or classes. This process is 
known as Text categorization. The problem in this is to classify 
documents into fixed number of classes. Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm can 
be used to perform text classification. 
Naive Bayes computes probabilities of the word to estimate the 
likelihood that a given document belongs to a particular class.
This probability estimate is used for decision making. We have 
applied same approach to train the classifier.
